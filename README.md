# 4Chan Big dAta Thingy #

### Still Under Development ###

## What ? ##

The 4chan Big dAta Thingy (4BAT) is a distributed analysis engine for 4chan using the [4chan json api](https://github.com/4chan/4chan-API)

## Why ? ##

This project is to develop my thinking and programming skills in the map reduce paradigm, also boredom.

## Why 4chan? ##

Mapreduce is used to process large datasets in parallel. 4chan is an interesting and "forum" with a simple structure and an api that provides quick and easy access to timestamped data in a serialized format.

## How? ##

(TODO)
